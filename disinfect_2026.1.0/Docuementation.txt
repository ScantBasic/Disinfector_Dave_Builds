Timeline of work @ScantBasic
Oct. 22, 2025: Started on Disinfect V1

Oct. 23, 2025: Added the Movement Physics for the player, as well as camera/keyboard control
Left off working on functional crouch, need to check if I ever stop crouching

Nov. 4, 2025: Fixed Crouching and the camera while crouching

Nov. 11, 2025: Hopefully the final camera while crouching fixes, as well as fixed the stair collisions
Stair collisions need more testing. Started a poll on if I am adding dashing or sliding into this first.
I also rewrote the camera bob code, it was garbage beforehand and now works good.

Nov. 18, 2025: Added double jumping & added wallrunning, might need to tweak some values. Stairs work, worse ramps
imo but they work. Removed camera smoothing because it will make aiming more whack later.

Nov. 25, 2025: Added sliding by basing it off of my old sliding code. Changed the camera controller to work with sliding more cleanly by using an older version
of the camera controller. Sliding also slows down on a upward slope and speeds up on a downward slope.

Dec. 2, 2025: Added a dash ability that I think is neat. It took 2 and a half hours to not be broken.

Dec. 16, 2025: Rewrote the dashing mechanics to be smoother and more in style with the rest of then engine.

Dec. 18, 2025: Added the ability to float midair and changed the rate at which you fall from a wall.

Dec. 23, 2025: Moved the Sliding code to not be in the grounded movement code. Also made and implemented
a pause menu and a debug HUD.

Dec. 30, 2025: Added basic controller intergration.

Jan 1, 2026: Changed Mouse and Controller sensitivity to be based on a DPI of 3600 to make controls more tolerable.

Jan 6, 2026: Fixed viewport scaling so the size of the GUI scales properly to other screen sizes than the default.

Jan 19, 2026: Changed a few values with the mouse input and dash to make movement more smooth.
Added a variable for mutiple dashes for later use.

Jan 20, 2026: Added a health component system, added fall damage to the player as well as a very simple
force pause on death, will replace with an actual death screen later.


Shoutout to Majikayo Games for amazing tutorials on stair handling and crouching.
