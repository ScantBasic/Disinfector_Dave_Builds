Timeline of work @ScantBasic
Oct. 22, 2025: Started on Disinfect V1

Oct. 23, 2025: Added the Movement Physics for the player, as well as camera/keyboard control
Left off working on functional crouch, need to check if I ever stop crouching

Nov. 4, 2025: Fixed Crouching and the camera while crouching

Nov. 11, 2025: Hopefully the final camera while crouching fixes, as well as fixed the stair collisions
Stair collisions need more testing. Started a poll on if I am adding dashing or sliding into this first.
I also rewrote the camera bob code, it was garbage beforehand and now works good.

Nov. 18, 2025: Added double jumping & added wallrunning, might need to tweak some values. Stairs work, worse ramps
imo but they work. Removed camera smoothing because it will make aiming more whack later.

Nov. 25, 2025: Added sliding by basing it off of my old sliding code. Changed the camera controller to work with sliding more cleanly by using an older version
of the camera controller. Sliding also slows down on a upward slope and speeds up on a downward slope.








Shoutout to Majikayo Games for amazing tutorials on stair handling and crouching.
